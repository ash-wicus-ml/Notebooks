    "# Creating a mortgage payoff schedule serves several purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "#  Understanding Payment Structure: It helps borrowers understand how their mortgage payments are structured over time. \n",
    "#  By breaking down each payment into principal and interest components, borrowers can see how much of each payment goes towards reducing \n",
    "#  the loan balance (principal) and how much goes towards paying the lender for borrowing the money (interest).\n",
    "\n",
    "#  Financial Planning: A payoff schedule enables borrowers to plan their finances effectively. They can anticipate future payments, \n",
    "#  budget accordingly, and make informed decisions about their mortgage and other financial commitments.\n",
    "\n",
    "#  Tracking Progress: The schedule allows borrowers to track their progress in paying off the loan. They can see how the remaining \n",
    "#  balance decreases over time and how much equity they are building in their home.\n",
    "\n",
    "#  Comparing Loan Options: When shopping for a mortgage or considering refinancing options, having a payoff schedule can help borrowers \n",
    "#  compare different loan terms and interest rates. They can assess the total cost of borrowing and choose the option that best fits their \n",
    "#  financial goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "#  Early Payoff Strategies: For borrowers interested in paying off their mortgage early, a payoff schedule provides insights into how \n",
    "#  extra payments or refinancing options can accelerate the payoff timeline and reduce overall interest costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "        \n",
    "# Input Variables:\n",
    "#  Principal: The total loan amount.\n",
    "#  Annual Rate: The annual interest rate as a percentage.\n",
    "#  Years: The loan term in years.\n",
    "#  Start Date: The date from which the payments start.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data Generation:\n",
    "# The payoff schedule is generated based on the input values, computing the monthly payment details and storing them in a DataFrame.\n"
