The tacos are street taco size and you get two of each type you order, so I got four tacos total. I was pretty full with four, three may have been ideal for me. Two tacos are 16 dollars. You can get cheaper tacos to be sure, but I wouldn't call these overpriced given the quality.\n",

      "- Guacamole Tradicional - The portion sizes were incredibly small, would not recommend ordering.\n",

      "- Enchiladas De Camaron - The star of the show and the main reason why this place gets so many stars. If I only ate this dish alone, I would've given it 5 stars. Hands-down one of the best enchiladas I ever had and probably the best Mexican food item I've had in NYC. The sauce was delicious and I loved the thick cut of shrimp that they put inside. The portion sizes were huge too and definitely could've comfortably brought half it back home.\n",

      "\n",
      "They have apps, tacos, and entrees such as enchiladas, fajitas, and steak. I had the birria tacos, which is essentially a tender beef stew taco. Though it was messy to eat, it packed a flavor punch that I would recommend to anyone. I also had the tacos de carnitas (pork, cilantro, Serrano salsa). It was also tender and very spicy! The tacos are street taco size and you get two of each type you order, so I got four tacos total. I was pretty full with four, three may have been ideal for me. Two tacos are 16 dollars. You can get cheaper tacos to be sure, but I wouldn't call these overpriced given the quality.\n",

      "They have an extensive mezcal/margarita/cocktail menu. I had the el maniaco, with reposado, blood orange purée, lime, and black lava salt. It was light and refreshing after a hot day. And then at the recommendation of the server I had the Mariachi with pineapple extract, habanero, lime, and mezcal tincture that was heavier and spicier, but also tasty. There were several interesting and attractive options!\n",

I had to make a fairly large reservation, and they were very nice accommodating me every step of the way as I kept changing the time and the number of people who came. They were super accommodating as we got seated immediately and even when we were \"stuck\" on appetizers and drinks for 1.5 hours, you know how large groups are, they were not bothered at all. Mad respect for that.\n",

      "- Pulque de Guayaba - When I asked for their sweetest drink on the menu, the waiter pointed me towards this one which honestly wasn't very sweet at all. The taste wasn't particularly memorable and I would not recommend it as the alcohol flavor was too strong (-1).\n",
      "- Guacamole Tradicional - The portion sizes were incredibly small, would not recommend ordering.\n",
      "- La Contenta Nachos - Absolutely yes! I'm so happy to have gotten this item as it was loaded with so many different ingredients. I loved the half-baked tortilla chips and the layering of the cheese on top. Could've just eaten this and been happy.\n",
      "- Enchiladas De Camaron - The star of the show and the main reason why this place gets so many stars. If I only ate this dish alone, I would've given it 5 stars. Hands-down one of the best enchiladas I ever had and probably the best Mexican food item I've had in NYC. The sauce was delicious and I loved the thick cut of shrimp that they put inside. The portion sizes were huge too and definitely could've comfortably brought half it back home.\n",

It's very cozy (aka tiny), but they do a solid job of laying out the tables efficiently to fit a decent amount of diners. It's great for brunch or dinner. I had the chilaquiles which were delicious. Chips maintained a slight crunch and the salsa verde was packed with flavor. Guac is also very well done and traditional. Margaritas and Micheladas are the way to go in terms of beverages. Staff are all very friendly and helpful.\n",

      "\n",
      "Food: we ordered the rojo guacamole to start. It has some heat that builds over time - it was delicious! They refill the chips for free as one basket is not enough between two adults and two teenage boys. I ordered the carne asada tacos - comes in two - with cheese. So flavorful! Some of the best I've had (and I'm from SoCal)! More 'wet' than traditional carne asada but that's the delicious marinade.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ambiance was nice - it was a good sit down place with great drinks and excellent food with lots of ppl enjoying themselves. It's a bit loud for little kiddos. Teenagers can hang here.\n",

      "Service: server was attentive, drinks, apps and food came out quickly. Water and soft drinks refilled promptly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bathroom: one dark bathroom. Sufficient for washing hands before dinner\n",
      "\n",
      "Price: Food is expensive nowadays. However, for the ambiance, drinks and food quality, it was on par with any other place price-wise. Yes more expensive than a restaurant you'd go into and eat standing up but it's part of the price point IMHO (you get what you pay for)\n",

      "I had the paella de quinoa, which was full of rich, savory, and smoky flavors. We had a side order of habanero salsa that helped bring some welcome heat. I wouldn't really call this a paella, but it was still tasty and creatively presented. My friends had the tacos de birria and pollo toloache, which they both seemed to enjoy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main issue with this restaurant is the prices, particularly for the small portion size. The food quality is definitely pretty high, but the entire meal (guacamole, three entrees, and a drink) came out to $140 after tax and tip. This might be worth it if you're also seeking a nice, somewhat trendy environment. If you're just here for the food, you might be able to find a cheaper option for the same quality.\n",

      "They have apps, tacos, and entrees such as enchiladas, fajitas, and steak. I had the birria tacos, which is essentially a tender beef stew taco. Though it was messy to eat, it packed a flavor punch that I would recommend to anyone. I also had the tacos de carnitas (pork, cilantro, Serrano salsa). It was also tender and very spicy! The tacos are street taco size and you get two of each type you order, so I got four tacos total. I was pretty full with four, three may have been ideal for me. Two tacos are 16 dollars. You can get cheaper tacos to be sure, but I wouldn't call these overpriced given the quality.\n",

      "- Enchiladas De Camaron - The star of the show and the main reason why this place gets so many stars. If I only ate this dish alone, I would've given it 5 stars. Hands-down one of the best enchiladas I ever had and probably the best Mexican food item I've had in NYC. The sauce was delicious and I loved the thick cut of shrimp that they put inside. The portion sizes were huge too and definitely could've comfortably brought half it back home.\n",

      "\n",
      "Drinks: highly recommend the Toaloche margarita. Not too sweet :) My husband ordered a 'double' which was too much for him. One packs a punch. They had assorted bottled Mexican sodas which my teenage boys enjoyed (Pineapple)\n",
      "\n",
      "Food: we ordered the rojo guacamole to start. It has some heat that builds over time - it was delicious! They refill the chips for free as one basket is not enough between two adults and two teenage boys. I ordered the carne asada tacos - comes in two - with cheese. So flavorful! Some of the best I've had (and I'm from SoCal)! More 'wet' than traditional carne asada but that's the delicious marinade.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ambiance was nice - it was a good sit down place with great drinks and excellent food with lots of ppl enjoying themselves. It's a bit loud for little kiddos. Teenagers can hang here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Service: server was attentive, drinks, apps and food came out quickly. Water and soft drinks refilled promptly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bathroom: one dark bathroom. Sufficient for washing hands before dinner\n",
      "\n",
      "Price: Food is expensive nowadays. However, for the ambiance, drinks and food quality, it was on par with any other place price-wise. Yes more expensive than a restaurant you'd go into and eat standing up but it's part of the price point IMHO (you get what you pay for)\n",

      "We ordered two drinks. My mom had sangria and I had a blueberry margarita. Both amazing!!\n",
      "\n",
      "I had shrimp tacos as my meal and my mom had a chicken quesadilla. She thoroughly enjoyed her dish and I loved mine.\n",

The red sauce that comes with chips needs to be in a bottle to sale. Chicken and lechón taco are delicious. The entrée, I had a tortilla with shrimp. Beautiful ambience there is a second floor. It is a small space but surprisingly comfortable.\n",

      "Review: My group split the frutas guacamole, which was very nice. I enjoyed the contrast between the rich avocado and the sweet and tart fruit. The guacamole order also came with a mild chipotle salsa, which was also nice.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had the paella de quinoa, which was full of rich, savory, and smoky flavors. We had a side order of habanero salsa that helped bring some welcome heat. I wouldn't really call this a paella, but it was still tasty and creatively presented. My friends had the tacos de birria and pollo toloache, which they both seemed to enjoy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main issue with this restaurant is the prices, particularly for the small portion size. The food quality is definitely pretty high, but the entire meal (guacamole, three entrees, and a drink) came out to $140 after tax and tip. This might be worth it if you're also seeking a nice, somewhat trendy environment. If you're just here for the food, you might be able to find a cheaper option for the same quality.\n",

As we approach the place , I realize he was referring to toloache ( he butchered the pronunciation that I couldn't recognize it but ofc , I know this place )!

      "Review: Food is always good here... a bit pricey but you will feel satisfied. The staff is great and always has agood happy hour drinks. The setting is nice for a small space but friendly service for sure ! My fav app was the mushroom truffle quesadilla. It was deffy full of flavor.

Our bartender was very attentive, and was chatting with us about different tequila recommendations to try while we were sitting at the bar. My friend and I split the guacamole and chips as an appetizer, and the guac was great. For my main course, I ordered three of the carne asada tacos, and my friend got the enchiladas. Both were delicious! I especially liked the enchiladas, so I will have to get those the next time I am back.\n",

Only lame thing about this place is that the host tried creating fake hype on how sold out the restaurant was. They refused to give us a table despite several empty tables around.

Though it was messy to eat, it packed a flavor punch that I would recommend to anyone. I also had the tacos de carnitas (pork, cilantro, Serrano salsa). It was also tender and very spicy! The tacos are street taco size and you get two of each type you order, so I got four tacos total. I was pretty full with four, three may have been ideal for me. Two tacos are 16 dollars. You can get cheaper tacos to be sure, but I wouldn't call these overpriced given the quality.\n",

The tacos are street taco size and you get two of each type you order, so I got four tacos total. I was pretty full with four, three may have been ideal for me. Two tacos are 16 dollars. You can get cheaper tacos to be sure, but I wouldn't call these overpriced given the quality.\n",

      "- Enchiladas De Camaron - The star of the show and the main reason why this place gets so many stars. If I only ate this dish alone, I would've given it 5 stars. Hands-down one of the best enchiladas I ever had and probably the best Mexican food item I've had in NYC. The sauce was delicious and I loved the thick cut of shrimp that they put inside. The portion sizes were huge too and definitely could've comfortably brought half it back home.\n",

      "I came here after searching for authentic Mexican food and not the american-mexican. While this restaurant lacks some great mexican dishes(small menu, but that's a good thing), you know a place is legit when they don't even have tacos for dinner(only the fish tacos). I have been itching to come back here for a year now. Don't have the time.\n",
      "Both date and I were greeted politely and the waiter even pulled out our chairs and handled our coats to hang it up in the back of your chair. Very nice gesture.\n",

      "Food: we ordered the rojo guacamole to start. It has some heat that builds over time - it was delicious! They refill the chips for free as one basket is not enough between two adults and two teenage boys. I ordered the carne asada tacos - comes in two - with cheese. So flavorful! Some of the best I've had (and I'm from SoCal)! More 'wet' than traditional carne asada but that's the delicious marinade.\n",

      "Service: server was attentive, drinks, apps and food came out quickly. Water and soft drinks refilled promptly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bathroom: one dark bathroom. Sufficient for washing hands before dinner\n",
      "\n",
      "Price: Food is expensive nowadays. However, for the ambiance, drinks and food quality, it was on par with any other place price-wise. Yes more expensive than a restaurant you'd go into and eat standing up but it's part of the price point IMHO (you get what you pay for)\n",

      "The main issue with this restaurant is the prices, particularly for the small portion size. The food quality is definitely pretty high, but the entire meal (guacamole, three entrees, and a drink) came out to $140 after tax and tip. This might be worth it if you're also seeking a nice, somewhat trendy environment. If you're just here for the food, you might be able to find a cheaper option for the same quality.\n",

      "My colleague couldn't stop raving over this place he refers to as a tequila bar . From a person who's been all over nyc , I couldn't believe the fact that I have t been to this place . As we approach the place , I realize he was referring to toloache ( he butchered the pronunciation that I couldn't recognize it but ofc , I know this place )! Featured in multiple shows and a place that set precedence for the other Mexican restaurants.\n",

      "Review: Food is always good here... a bit pricey but you will feel satisfied. The staff is great and always has agood happy hour drinks. The setting is nice for a small space but friendly service for sure ! My fav app was the mushroom truffle quesadilla. It was deffy full of flavor. The guacamole was sort of bland but if you add hot sauce etc it will taste fine after! (Well if you like spice )\n",
